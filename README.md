# CrowdPlay

Real-time song requests for DJs and their crowd.

## What is CrowdPlay?

CrowdPlay connects DJs and their audience in real time. Fans request songs, upvote favorites, and watch the queue update live — no app download needed.

## How It Works

### Scan & Join
Fans scan a QR code or enter a short session code — no account needed.

### Search & Request
Browse millions of tracks and add your pick to the live queue instantly.

### Upvote & Rise
Duplicate requests become upvotes — the most wanted songs climb higher.

### DJ Controls
DJs manage the queue with full control — play, skip, reorder, or end the session.

## For DJs

- Create up to 20 sessions with shareable QR codes
- Reorder, skip, or remove songs in real time
- End a session and come back later — your queue stays
- See who requested what and how many votes it got

## For Fans

- Join instantly — no sign up, no download
- Search the entire Deezer catalog for free
- See what's playing right now in real time
- Upvote songs others already requested
